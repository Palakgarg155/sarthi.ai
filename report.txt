QUESTION SCORES
Q1: 3/5.0 - The student has provided a basic understanding of globalisation, but the answer lacks depth and detail. The student has correctly identified some key aspects, but has missed out on important elements such as foreign investment and movement of technology.
Q2: 3/5.0 - The student has demonstrated a basic understanding of how MNCs control production, but their answer is incomplete and lacks the nuance of the ground truth answer. The score of 3 reflects the student's ability to identify some key aspects of MNCs' production control, but also acknowledges the gaps in their knowledge.
Q3: 2/5.0 - The student has shown some understanding of the topic, but their answer lacks depth and clarity. They have not fully grasped the concept of foreign investment and its distinction from foreign trade.
Q4: 4/5.0 - The student demonstrates a good understanding of the concept of liberalisation of foreign trade, but the answer could be more precise and comprehensive. The student is able to capture the essence of the concept, but lacks detail and clarity.
Q5: 3/5.0 - The student demonstrates a basic understanding of how ICT contributes to globalization but fails to provide a comprehensive and detailed explanation as expected. The answer is simplistic and does not cover the full scope of ICT's role in global integration.
Q6: 2/5.0 - The student has shown a basic understanding of the WTO's role in making and enforcing trade rules, but the answer is lacking in depth and detail. The score of 2 out of 5 reflects the student's limited understanding of the topic.
Q7: 3/5.0 - The student has demonstrated a basic understanding of how globalisation has impacted Indian consumers, but the answer lacks depth and specificity. While the student has correctly identified some benefits, the answer does not fully address the question and lacks detail.
Q8: 3/5.0 - The student demonstrates a basic understanding of trade barriers and their use by India after independence. However, the answer lacks detail and specificity, particularly in defining trade barriers and explaining the rationale behind their use. The score of 3 reflects this partial understanding.
Q9: 3/5.0 - The student has shown some understanding of the topic by identifying the main issue faced by small producers. However, the answer lacks depth and specific details, which are necessary to fully address the question. Therefore, a score of 3 out of 5 is justified.
Q10: 2/5.0 - The student has shown some understanding of the concept of making globalization fair, but the answer lacked depth and specificity. The student failed to provide concrete examples and missed several key points mentioned in the ground truth answer.
